## Getting Started

For usage-only, please go to the [main website](https://a-rmz.github.io/sbotify/). There you'll find all the information you need use the app.

Now, if you want to run your own instance, this is the place to be.

### Prerequisites

#### Docker and Docker Compose
- Follow the instructions on the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) website and install the version corresponding to your OS
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Spotify
- Go to [Spotify developer's site](https://developer.spotify.com/) and create a new app.
- Keep the tab open, you'll need the Client ID and Secret soon

#### Slack
- Go to [Slack apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new one.
- Create a [Slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) `/sbotify` (or however you wanna call it) that redirects you to
  - `https://youraddress.com/slack/incoming`
- Create an [Interactive Message](https://api.slack.com/interactive-messages) integration that points to
  - `https://youraddress.com/slack/postback`
  - That is used for the buttons that will share the content
- Activate the [bot user](https://api.slack.com/bot-users)
  - *Pro tip:* Use a cool bot name üòé
  - The bot will be in charge of sending the music across the team
  - Go to OAuth & Permissions and add the `chat:write:bot` permission

[Optional]
- In case you want to use OAuth
  - Go to OAuth & Permissions and add a new Redirect URL redirects to
  - `https://youraddress.com/slack/auth`

**NOTE:** All the URLs you provide for your app must be secure (`https`).

#### Sticking all together
Now, going back to your environment, copy and rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required variables:

```
NODE_ENV -> current environment (development, testing, production)
LOGFILE -> name of the file that will be used to log

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -> password for the MySQL root user

DB_HOST -> host for the credentials database
DB_PORT -> port for the credentials database
DB_NAME -> name of the credentials database to be used
DB_USER -> user to access the credentials database
DB_PASS -> password for the db user

BASE_URL -> url of the website (in case you're not using authentication, you can leave it blank -but don't delete it)
PORT -> port for the app to run

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID -> Taken from the Spotify app you created
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET -> idem

SLACK_CLIENT_ID -> From the Slack app dashboard
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET -> idem
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI -> OAuth redirect uri (in case you're not using authentication, you can leave it blank)

```

```
$ npm install
