Ez-pz, right?

## What will it do to my team?
You might be wondering: what will this mighty wonderful app do with my great Slack team? Well, fear no more, because this is what will happen.
* A slash command will be added.
  * You can call the app by doing `/sbotify`.
* A bot user (`@sbotify`) will be added (he's not very talkative).

## How do I use it?
You can search for a **song**, an **artist**, or an **album**, by simply calling:
```
/sbotify song name-of-the-song
/sbotify artist name-of-the-artist
/sbotify album name-of-the-album
```

That's it. That's the most basic usage.

You can also perform more complex queries, like adding the artist or the album after the song name, like this:
```
/sbotify song name-of-the-song name-of-the-artist name-of-the-album
```
This will get you more accurate results, or more specific, in case you're searching for a common term.
