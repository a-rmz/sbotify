      <h1 id="what">what will it do to my team?</h1>
      <p>
        You might be wondering: what will this mighty wonderful app do with my great Slack team? Well, fear no more, because this is what will happen.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A slash command will be added.
          <li>You can call the app by doing <code>/sbotify</code>.</li>
        </li>
        <li>A bot user (<code>@sbotify</code>) will be added (he's not very talkative).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="how">
      <h1>how do I use it?</h1>
      <p>
        You can search for a <b>song</b>, an <b>artist</b>, or an <b>album</b>, by simply calling:
      </p>
      <code class="block">
        /sbotify song name-of-the-song<br>
        /sbotify artist name-of-the-artist<br>
        /sbotify album name-of-the-album<br>
      </code>
      <p>
        That's it. That's the most basic usage.

        You can also perform more complex queries, like adding the artist or the album after the song name, like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        /sbotify song name-of-the-song name-of-the-artist name-of-the-album
      </code>
      <p>
        This will get you more accurate results, or more specific, in case you're searching for a common term.
      </p>

        This project is just made for fun. The only data kept is the id, name and token of your team, which is needed for the app to work. Otherwise, we don't store any other data, nor is it public.
