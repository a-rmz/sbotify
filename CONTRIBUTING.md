# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to reach this far! It's great to see that you're as interested in this project as I am. 😄 Here you'll find everything you need to know to contribute to this project. This project is made by people for people, so, by following this guidelines, you help your peer developers (like me 👋🏼) to help you developing the new features you have in mind or fixing the bugs or issues you find. Of course, all the help is appreciated, from code to docs, even by recommending this project you're helping!

Also, this project is ruled by [Contributor Convenant](http://contributor-covenant.org)'s [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Getting started
## Code Contributions

Now, the fun part! (Based on [Node JS](github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) contribution guide)

### Step 1: Fork

Fork the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/a-rmz/sbotify) and clone your fork in your local.

```text
$ git clone git@github.com:username/sbotify.git
$ cd sbotify
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/a-rmz/sbotify.git
```

#### Which branch?

The `master` branch holds the latest release code, so for development and bug fixing, `develop` is your way to go.

### Step 2: Branch

Create a branch and start hacking:

```text
$ git checkout -b my-branch -t origin/develop
```
### Step 3: Commit

Make sure git knows your name and email address:

```text
$ git config --global user.name "J. Random User"
$ git config --global user.email "j.random.user@example.com"
```

Add and commit:

```text
$ git add my/changed/files
$ git commit
```

### Commit message guidelines

To avoid this:
![commits-xkcd](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1c4989b1a9729535c11498bb990b6c4622ebfb8b/68747470733a2f2f696d67732e786b63642e636f6d2f636f6d6963732f6769745f636f6d6d69742e706e67)

The commit message should describe what changed and why. Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

1. The first line should:
   - start with a capital letter
   - contain a short description of the change
   - be 50 characters or less
   - be entirely in lowercase with the exception of proper nouns, acronyms, and
   the words that refer to code, like function/variable names

2. Keep the second line blank.
3. Wrap all other lines at 72 columns.

4. If your patch fixes an open issue, you can add a reference to it at the end
of the log. Use the `Fixes:` prefix and the full issue URL. For other references
use `Refs:`.

   Examples:
   - `Fixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1337`
   - `Refs: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/space-in-parens.html`
   - `Refs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3615`

Sample complete commit message:

```txt
explain the commit in one line

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent

Fixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1337
Refs: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/space-in-parens.html
```

### Step 4: Rebase

Use `git rebase` (not `git merge`) to synchronize your work with
the main repository.

```text
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/develop
```

### Step 5: Test

Bug fixes and features should come with tests. Looking at
other tests to see how they should be structured can also help.
Follow the directory structure to add your tests.

To run the tests on Unix / macOS:

```text
$ [npm | yarn] test
```

If you want to run the linter, you can do
```
$ [npm | yarn] run lint
```

Make sure the linter does not report any issues and that all tests pass. Please
do not submit patches that fail either check.

### Step 6: Push

```text
$ git push origin my-branch
```

### Step 7: Discuss and update

You will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your Pull Request.
This is a big part of the submission process so don't be discouraged!

To make changes to an existing Pull Request, make the changes to your branch.
When you push that branch to your fork, GitHub will automatically update the
Pull Request.

You can push more commits to your branch:

```text
$ git add my/changed/files
$ git commit
$ git push origin my-branch
```

Or you can rebase against develop:

```text
$ git fetch --all
$ git rebase origin/develop
$ git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch
```

Or you can amend the last commit (for example if you want to change the commit
log).

```text
$ git add any/changed/files
$ git commit --amend
$ git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch
```

Feel free to post a comment in the Pull Request to ping reviewers if you are
awaiting an answer on something. If you encounter words or acronyms that
seem weird, check this
[glossary](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/glossary).

### Step 8: Landing

In order to land, a Pull Request needs to be reviewed and
[approved](#getting-approvals-for-your-pull-request) by
at least one Collaborator.
After that, as long as there are no objections
from a Collaborator, the Pull Request can be merged.

## Additional Notes
### Getting Approvals for Your Pull Request

A Pull Request is approved either by saying LGTM, which stands for
"Looks Good To Me", or by using GitHub's Approve button.
GitHub's Pull Request review feature can be used during the process.
For more information, check out
[the video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW0RPaJqm4g)
or [the official documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/).

After you push new changes to your branch, you need to get
approval for these new changes again, even if GitHub shows "Approved"
because the reviewers have hit the buttons before.


# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue.
Email [me](mailto:armzprz@gmail.com) instead.

If you want to report a bug or issue, go to the
[new issue](https://github.com/a-rmz/sbotify/issues/new) section and fill the template.
Also, add the tag `bug`.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you'd like a feature to be added, fill an issue describing what would you like
the new feature to do and tag it as `feature-suggestion`. Be as descriptive as possible!
A best description will make it clearer for other people to understand what you want
and help you achieve it. 😉
